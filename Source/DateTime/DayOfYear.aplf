⍝ Years are normally considered to begin on the first day of the first
⍝ month (0101) of the calendar year, but to support odd fiscal years a
⍝ different beginning-of-year month/day number (0101-1231) may be
⍝ specified as an optional left argument.
⍝ Alternatively, a single digit may be specified indicating that the
⍝ year should begin on a specific day of the first calendar week,
⍝ where 1=Sunday ... 7=Saturday.
⍝ The default left argument is 0, which indicates the calendar beginning
⍝ of the year (the same as 0101).
